# lococlu
Low Coupling Cluster, based on Bash scripts, for RAW Image over NFS structure

v0.1

First working version with limited function.
Still need some tests to make sure everything works as expected.

Missing parts:
Head and Node deploy scripts missing.
Join domain script missing.
Missing user image create auto balance, currently only create user images in /images/vol01
Also maybe missing some other function on cross NFS filer structure

Anyway, too later, too tired, let's call this v0.1

v0.0

Function not complete yet.
