v0.1

First working version with limited function.
Still need some tests to make sure everything works as expected.

Missing parts:
Security designs.
Head and Node deploy scripts missing.
Join domain script missing.
Missing user image create auto balance, currently only create user images in /images/vol01
Also maybe missing some other function on cross NFS filer structure

Anyway, too later, too tired, let's call this v0.1

v0.0

Function not complete yet.
